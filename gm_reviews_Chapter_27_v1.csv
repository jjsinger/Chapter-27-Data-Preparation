We both are chocolate people and did not get very good chocolate ice cream. I ordered a chocolate black cherry milkshake and it ended up just tasting like vanilla with chocolate syrup mixed in and no cherry was present at all! My husband ordered the fudge ripple flavor which was actually just vanilla with a tiny ribbon of fudge that you could hardly taste. So it did not meet our expectations. The texture was smooth and the prices were good, and if you only like vanilla then this is a place for you.
